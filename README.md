## task1: Data preparation and customer analytics
 I'm part of Quantium’s retail analytics team who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region. The insights from my analysis will feed into the supermarket’s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.
 
 I should :
 
Examine transaction data – look for inconsistencies, missing data across the data set, outliers, correctly identified category items, numeric data across all tables. Determine any anomalies make the necessary changes in the dataset and save it. 

Examine customer data – check for similar issues in the customer data, look for nulls and when you are happy merge the transaction and customer data together.

Data analysis and customer segments  – look at total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from etc. Explore the data, create charts and graphs as well as noting any interesting trends and/or insights you find. These will all form part of our report to Julia.
